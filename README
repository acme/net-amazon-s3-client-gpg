NAME
    Net::Amazon::S3::GPG - Use GPG with Amazon S3 - Simple Storage Service

SYNOPSIS
      use Net::Amazon::S3;
      my $aws_access_key_id     = 'fill me in';
      my $aws_secret_access_key = 'fill me in too';
      my $gpg_recipient         = 'fill@meintoo.com';
      my $gpg_passphrase        = 'secret!';

      my $s3 = Net::Amazon::S3->new(
          aws_access_key_id     => $aws_access_key_id,
          aws_secret_access_key => $aws_secret_access_key,
          retry                 => 1,
      );

      my $gnupg = GnuPG::Interface->new();
      $gnupg->options->hash_init(
          armor            => 0,
          recipients       => [$gpg_recipient],
          meta_interactive => 0,
      );

      my $client = Net::Amazon::S3::Client::GPG->new(
          s3              => $s3,
          gnupg_interface => $gnupg,
          passphrase      => $gpg_passphrase,
      );

      # then can call $object->gpg_get, $object->gpg_get_filename,
      # $object->gpg_put, $object->$gpg_put_filename on
      # Net::Amazon::S3::Object objects.

DESCRIPTION
    Net::Amazon::S3 provides a simple interface to Amazon's Simple Storage
    Service. GnuPG::Interface provides a Perl interface to GNU Privacy
    Guard, an implementation of the OpenPGP standard. Net::Amazon::S3 can
    use SSL so that data can not be intercepted while in transit over the
    internet, but Amazon recommends that "users can encrypt their data
    before it is uploaded to Amazon S3 so that the data cannot be accessed
    or tampered with by unauthorized parties".

    This module adds methods to Net::Amazon::S3::Object to get and put
    values and files while encrypting and decrypting them.
